# Rock Engineer's Toolbox 
A suite of tools intended to help Rock Engineers in decision making and simplifying tedious tasks. From tools like Pillar Stability Analyzers to 
Borehole Analysis tools this suite of tools are intended to be the Rock Engineer's Toolbelt. Focusing on delivering quality tooling that is intuitive to use and delivers acurate results.

## Pillar Stability Analyzer 
The Pillar Stability tool is used to determine the strength and safety factor of support pillars in underground openings. By simulating thousands of possible
scenarios given the properties of a certain support pillar useful insight can be derived like the PoF(Probability of Failure), Average Pillar Stress, Safety Factor
to name a few.

### Simulation
By leveraging the capabilities of modern computing thousands of simulations can be computed with a multitude of algorithms to a closely as possible determine the 
actual strength and safety factor of a support pillar.

## Caveability Analyzer 
This tool is used to determine the stability of unsupported underground excavations. By analyzing each wall face individually the optimal dimensions of the room
can be calculated to ensure stability of the excavation.

## Roadmap 
This project is intended to continue development building new tools, and improving current tools down the road. The Following tools and feautres are on the horizon:
- Borehore Analyzer 
- Reporting Functionality 
- Saving system 

## Contributions 
All contributions and feedback would be greatly appresiated. To give feedback or report bugs please create a Issue on the repo. To contibute to the project just 
create a Pull Request on a side branch and I will get back to you as soos as possible.
